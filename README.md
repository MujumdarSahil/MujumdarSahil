## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Junior Data Scientist with 6.5+ months of industry experience**, working on applied machine learning and AI-driven systems across analytics, security, and predictive modeling domains.

My interests lie at the intersection of **🤖 Machine Learning, 🧠 Generative AI & Agentic AI, 🔐 Cybersecurity, and ☁️ Cloud Systems**. I focus on **system-level AI design**, where models, data, infrastructure, and security constraints come together in production-oriented environments.

I have previously worked on **government-scale data systems** at the **🏛️ National Informatics Centre (NIC), Government of India**, and gained exposure to **enterprise-grade security and networking concepts** through a **🌐 Zscaler virtual internship**. I also have a **research-oriented background**, with **one published IEEE conference paper** and ongoing research work.
